# UsefulGoogleSheetScripts
A Repository of useful Google sheet scripts that you can add to your sheet and automate trivial tasks

PRs are welcome; I usually googled Google sheet Scripts I need for automating my tasks. I wanted to create a collaboratory for everyone to use and not to redo my work.

### TrackRowEdit.gs
Adds a time stamp when a particular column was last edited


### ProtectFromEdit.gs
Protect a range from being edited by anyone but the owner of the sheet

### AddValueNewSheetEdit.gs
Add value from a particular sheet to a new sheet on edit


### SendEmailData.gs
Send email with content based on filters; I use it to automate what my ToDo Lists are and send them in my email
